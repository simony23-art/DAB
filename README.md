This repository documents my Master 2 project on a Dual Active Bridge (DAB) bidirectional DC-DC converter. The project features a two-pronged approach:

Simulation: Detailed studies of converter performance have been carried out over a voltage range of 48V to 400V. These simulations help analyze dynamic behavior, power efficiency, and control strategy optimization.

Implementation: A practical prototype of the converter has been implemented for voltage conversion between 24V and 48V. This real-world setup validates the simulation results and demonstrates the system's robustness in a controlled environment.

The combined simulation and experimental work offers valuable insights into converter design, control techniques, and performance analysis for modern power systems.
